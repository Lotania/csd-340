			<h1>Assignment 2.2 â€“ Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2</h1>
			<h2>Chapter About Me</h2>
			<p class="intro">Things are happening at my work. What started as me simply typing prescriptions became me helping my coworkers adjust to the new system, assisting patients with payments, and handling special accounts, all with a decent upgrade in pay. I've been at the job for a few months, so it stands to reason that the field moves fast. You have to be able to adapt to new responsibilities, or else you'll get left behind with nothing.</p>
			<p>Between my two sons and wife, work, house maintenance, and school, I need to find some kind of release to avoid having a mental shutdown. So, I decided to resurrect some hobbies that I have long abandoned. Due to my schedule, my hobbies are limited to occasional workouts and fanfiction writing. I manage to squeeze in a little bit of time a day, and it's helping me stay sane.</p>
			<p>I'm trying to get my mind back to fantasizing to avoid coming off as a boring husk. So, what better way than diving into the world of Yu-Gi-Oh, where the fate of the world depends on painted cardboard? And writing a fanfiction about it? Sure. You're not going to believe what I conjured.</p>
			<p>Exercising to a heavy sweat is my personal meditation because it provides a release for my frustrations. The weights don't care what happened; they only care about how you move. And move, I did, as I was able to throw 230 pounds over my head, but just barely. They want my all, and I give my all, and I feel like a massive weight has been lifted off my shoulders. <span class="sentence">And no, it's not because I dropped it on the lifting platform behind me.</span></p>
