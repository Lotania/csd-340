			<h3>THE CONDUIT</h3>
			
			<h3>CHAPTER 1: What Goes On In a Day</h3>
			
			<p>I have no idea how I was born.</p>
			
			<p>I have no idea why.</p>
			
			<p>All I know is that I am a person who just…became. I'm on a soft patch of grass, in the middle of a busy <span id="metropolitan">________</span> park, with people passing me by not bothering with a quick glance.</p>
			
			<p>
				<button type="button"
					onclick="document.getElementById('metropolitan').innerHTML = firstButton">metropolitan</button> <br />   
			</p> 
			
			<p>I know that my lack of purpose into this world should alarm me greatly, but for some reason I'm fine with this. Before I was suddenly thrust into the world, I was nothing. Just a presence without form, in a world without light. I couldn't see or feel anything. I could only hear.</p>
			
			<p><b>"HELP ME! HEEEEEEEELP MEEEEEEEEEEE..."</b></p>
			
			<p>I could hear <span id="despairing">________</span> voices.</p>
			<p>
				<button type="button"
					onclick="document.getElementById('despairing').innerHTML = secondButton">despairing</button> <br />   
			</p> 
			
			<p><b>"PLEASE FORGIVE ME!"</b></p>
			
			<p>Those voices…They've lingered long before I was born…</p>
			
			<p><b>"I NEVER ASKED FOR ANY OF THIS!"</b></p>
			
			<p>They all scream of lives cut short by <span id="horrible">________</span> things that either happened to them, or happened because of them.</p>
			
			<p>
				<button type="button"
					onclick="document.getElementById('horrible').innerHTML = thirdButton">horrible</button> <br />   
			</p> 
			
			<p><b>"I CAN'T BE THE LAST! HOW COULD I DO THIS TO THEM?!"</b></p>
			
			<p><b>"I ONLY WANTED WHAT BEST FOR MY SON! WHYYYYYYYYY~"</b></p>
			
			<p>Day in and day out, the voices grow loud <span id="enough">________</span> to become my only thoughts. Those thoughts eventually became me. But it's never bothered me, since I figured I could put those voices to go use. But on this particular day, they seem at ease for-</p>
			
			<p>
				<button type="button"
					onclick="document.getElementById('enough').innerHTML = fourthButton">enough</button> <br />

			<p>"…Meteor of Destruction!"</p>
			
			<p>Wait-huh?</p>
			
			<p>"Dude … direct … anymore!"</p>
			
			<p>*FWOOSH!*</p>
			
			<p>A big flaming rock headed towards the Earth? Nothing I can't handle. It only takes me a split second to jump off my back, manifest a black titanium-fitted DuelDisk, and launch myself out of a Compulsory Evacuation Device right into the Meteor. I swing my Disk at the big red-</p>
			
			<p>*FZZTZZZ…*</p>
			
			<p>…hologram? Uh, what?</p>
			
			<p>"Bro, what the heck was that for?!"</p>
			
			<p>"Sandra, your-"</p>
			
			<p><b>*BLAM!*</b></p>
			
			<p>"---" (LP -1000)</p>
			
			<p>"BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA! Oh, the look on your face-AAAHAHAHAHAAAAA!"</p>
			
			<p>"Rrrrgh…Magikuriboh!"</p>
			
			<p>Ok…that was less real than I thought it'd be. I'm gonna use my wings to get me out of-</p>
			
			<p>"GET THIS THING OFFA ME!" (LP -2000)</p>
			
			<p>"That's what you get for blasting me with that rock!"</p>
			
			<p>Why's that Dark Magician Girl manhandling a duelist?…I don't…huh…</p>
			
			<p>"Hey, you!"</p>
			
			<p>Crud, "Me?"</p>
			
			<p>"Why'd you go and butt in like that, huh?!"</p>
			
			<p>"It wasn't gonna change anything," I flatly said, "In fact, your 4-card combo required you to take damage, so why are you complaining?"</p>
			
			<p>"Well…you just don't butt in someone's Duel like that!"</p>
			
			<p>"This coming from the girl with three copies of Dark Magician, Dark Magician Girl, and The Dark Magicians. And no copies of Bond Between Teacher and Student."</p>
			
			<p>"Uh…you don't know that!" she's stammering.</p>
			
			<p>Just then, the other duelist came up to me, "Hey, how're you able to guess what's in her deck like that?"</p>
			
			<p>Welp. Time for an exposition dump. Which I will not subject you to because I just started this spiel. I will say that it was enough to stop the Duel and bring everyone to a picnic table, after obtaining burgers.</p>
			
			<p>"Dude, what?" Sandra was just in awe, "So, you're this being of Darkness? You don't seem so dark to me."</p>
			
			<p>"Well, if these eyes don't scream Darkness," I pointed to my pair of black sclera, white-fading-down-to-red irises, and snake-like black pupils, "I've done a good job blending in."</p>
			
			<p>"But there's no way you've been around for 10,000 years," the other duelist was skeptical of my story, and I don't blame her.</p>
			
			<p>"I suppose you're right. I mean, these cards are my only proof," I show them my Mushroom Man (Normal), Mushroom Man #2 (Effect), and Mushroom Man King (P12, LINK-3). As expected, they were both floored.</p>
			
			<p>"No one makes Mushroom Man anymore! How did you-"</p>
			
			<p>"I wasn't kidding when I said I've been around. And, boy have I been."</p>
			
			<p>After talking with them for another hour, I wave them goodbye and go on my merry way.</p>
			
			<p>It doesn't take too long before I'm on my own again. Walking on my own, passing a blank glance at the world around me. There's many people populating this walkway, but they don't seem too bothered by me. Maybe it's because I walked up with a navy-blue shirt, khaki pants, and sandals. Trust me, that doesn't happen often; usually I'm in something more striking, but this allows me to blend in easier. I always go to a certain place because I'm drawn to it, and the voices in my head might have something to do with it. I can't say for certain. But this place has a certain rally led by a certain zealous individual that often crashes small business stands. After walking a while, I sit down on a…</p>
			
			<p>…concrete bench right by a bonsai tree. Oh, no. I'm dealing with an over privileged nutjob, aren't I?…</p>
			
			<p><b>*BAM!*</b></p>
			
			<p>"He's a racist fascist! He's the reason we're all being arrested!"</p>
			
			<p>And a political one, too. Why am I here again?</p>
			
			<p>"I voted Democrat! Please, you have to-"</p>
			
			<p>"No, you didn't! You're going around poisoning our families!"</p>
			
			<p>And a crowd gathers round to…</p>
			
			<p>"Let me go!"</p>
			
			<p>"Get him!"</p>
			
			<p>"He lied about being gay!"</p>
			
			<p>…there's a reason people say, 'Keep politics out of fill-in-the-blank.' The Satellite sounds like paradise compared to this.</p>
			
			<p>A little background. The person (pronoun: they/them. Yes, I went there…) who accused that man of being a fascist (even though I saw that man voting Democrat and supporting immigrants) has a habit of playing the victim card whenever they don't get their way. Sound familiar? Well, this person's Deck is full of victim cards. Cards I'd rather not see Industrial Illusions even mention. I've been tailing this person for the past 24 hours, and already I wanna-</p>
			
			<p>"Hey, you got a problem?!"</p>
			
			<p>Wup-they spotted me. Escalate or de-escalate? I mean, that's my target, but I don't wanna-</p>
			
			<p>"Hey, Nazi! You wanna come at me, or what?!"</p>
			
			<p>Escalate. "That guy wasn't doing anything! He's just giving out blue hats!"</p>
			
			<p>"Don't throw that nonsense at me! You know full well he's a fascist!"</p>
			
			<p>Target acquired. Engage now. "Says the <em>woman</em> who's dresses like Rainbow Dragon's vomit."</p>
			
			<p>"Di…did that little shithead just…<em>misgender me?!"</em></p>
			
			<p>Come on, then, "You hear me, <b>lady.</b> You're nothing before me! You're not even worth the dirt on my shoes!"</p>
			
			<p>The angry mob starts coming onto me. And just like that, the person is the first to come within reach.</p>
			
			<p>"You are going to apologize right now!" They (still one person) say with angry jeers directed from the crowd. One of them threw a fork at me.</p>
			
			<p>"No, illegal immigrant."</p>
			
			<p>"I AM A CITIZEN!"</p>
			
			<p>"Could've fooled me!"</p>
			
			<p>One of their friends jumps in, "Kick his butt! He's stupid!"</p>
			
			<p>"Yeah, you're going down!" They reach for me.</p>
			
			<p>Just what I wanted. The instant they touch my head, time comes to an abrupt halt, and the world turns a dark shade of purple. They didn't notice because they punched me to the ground. They only noticed because I disappeared into the ground.</p>
			
			<p>"Huh?" They seem shocked, "What is this? What kind of sick stunt are you trying to pull?!"</p>
			
			<p>"It's no stunt," I say right behind their ear. They turn around, but I'm not there anymore. In fact, I'm right in front of them, "It's a game of sorts."</p>
			
			<p>"Game of…what the hell kind of nonsense are you talking about?!"</p>
			
			<p>"I'm talking about playing a game with you."</p>
			
			<p>"A what?!"</p>
			
			<p>"A game. Was I not clear before?" I wave my hand again, and manifest a table full of face down playing cards, "You want everything to go back to normal? You'll play this game by the rules I set, and you'll win using those rules."</p>
			
			<p>"This..this is some kind of BS, bro…" They're backing away, "Screw this, I don't have to take any shit from y-" Right when they start to walk off, a giant monstrous claws reaches for them, "AHHHHHH!" They immediately return to the table and start panting heavily.</p>
			
			<p>"Now, do you understand?" I say, "You're now a participant in this Game of Darkness. Declining to play is not an option. You will play by the rules, or there will be consequences."</p>
			
			<p>They're still panting. But at least they seem to believe, "Ok…ok…all I have to do is beat you in this stupid game, right?…Well, fine! Let's get this outta the way!"</p>
			
			<p>"Well said," I say as we both take our seats. They aren't very amused…or scared. Rather, they seem annoyed at me.</p>
			
			<p>"What the hell is this?!" They say, "It's just concentration! Why do I even-"</p>
			
			<p>"No, don't-"</p>
			
			<p>And a memory of that person is shown to the both of us.</p>
			
			<p>"RGH! UUUGHH…"</p>
			
			<p>...Ok. What spirits have possessed me to come to this bloated privilege of a place?…I'm not sure if I wanna know...</p>
			
			<p>...but I wanna know why they're keeled over. They struggled with their composure, "Ugh...what...was that...I can't..."</p>
			
			<p>"Really? A memory wiped you out?"</p>
			
			<p>"Shut up! You're the one who made this crazy game!"</p>
			
			<p>"But I didn't jump the gun and flip a card over. You did."</p>
			
			<p>"Ugh…" Well, at least they're now willing to listen.</p>
			
			<p>Now, for my usual bit, "As you just saw, this is Concentration, with a twist. None of these cards have a number on them. Instead, they contain one half of a picture of a random memory plucked from our brains. The turn player chooses a card to flip over, which contains a half picture. That player must then choose another card to flip over, and if that card's picture completes the first card's picture, the player takes that pair, and that player continues to choose. cards. If not, both cards get flipped face down, and the turn is passed to the next player."</p>
			
			<p>"I know about the rules! But what's with the flashing in my eyes?!"</p>
			
			<p>"Oh, that. Each time you flip a card over, a random memory that's associated with that card's picture is displayed for both of us to see. You'll have to endure those memories as the game progresses."</p>
			
			<p>"Memory?! Then…what you just saw…"</p>
			
			<p>"Yeah. You've been quite the bully in high school, haven't you? Apparently, your accusatory tactics began to manifest there. What caused it? Guy rejected you? Teacher gave you a failing grade?"</p>
			
			<p>"Shut the hell up, you lousy-" Bad move. They try to throw a punch at me. All I did was dodge, and they fell over and collapsed the game board like a clumsy clod!</p>
			
			<p>"Can I just say…I didn't touch you that time?" I'm just enjoying them struggle to get out of the pile of cards they've buried themselves in, "And you are really lucky the game hasn't started yet, otherwise you'd have a problem."</p>
			
			<p>"God…dammit…" they brushed themselves off and just stood there, resigned to their fate, "So, I really do have to play to get outta here, don't I?"</p>
			
			<p>"At last, you see the predicament," I finally get an acknowledgement out of them and I snap my fingers to reset the table, "Now, where was I?"</p>
			
			<p>We sit down at the table, and they finally take everything in, "Anything else I need to keep in mind?"</p>
			
			<p>I point to my center left, and a timer appears on the table, "There's 60 cards here. 30 pairs, but there are 45 minutes to finish the game." I point to the center right, and a floating stopwatch appears, "The turn player also has 30 seconds to pick their initial card; the turn player can't take too long to pick their first card, otherwise the game automatically ends in that player's defeat." Then I point to the opposite side, with a second stopwatch, "After picking the first card, the player will have 60 seconds to pick each subsequent card; take too long to pick a subsequent card, the turn automatically ends. Obviously, whoever has the most pairs by game's end wins. How about it? Ready to play?"</p>
			
			<p>"Yes…Yes, I am." They've simmered down, "I want you to go first."</p>
			
			<p>"Fair enough. Game start."</p>
			
			<p><b>—TIME REMAINING 45:00—</b></p>
			
			<p>Oh, they're gonna regret that. Right now, a few spirits are possessing me, so once I flip over a card, I don't know what I'm gonna see. It takes me one second to flip the card nearest to me. And it shows half of a circular stone.</p>
			
			<p>"What the hell is that?" They demand from me.</p>
			
			<p>"Honestly, I'm not sure-" Suddenly, the entire area turns into a village on fire. Horse riders stampeding throughout the walkways, soldiers with spears and swords driving other villagers out and into the presence of a menacing army. I didn't expect to see this. And my opponent's immediately drawn to a child and woman being dragged by the hair and thrown to the commander.</p>
			
			<p>"What is this…" they muttered, "What am I even seeing?…"</p>
			
			<p>My hand reaches for one of the center cards. I eye it, and… "Looks like we're about to find out…" it's the stone's other half. And then, the world goes completely black, save for one small glow right behind me. I only took one glance at the glow…and it's from someone's pov. That someone is seeing freshly ripped body parts being dumped into a pot full of melted gold. I couldn't help but feel a twinge of anger and regret. This memory belongs to a spirit inside me.</p>
			
			<p>I'd like to dwell on this a little longer, but I can't waste too much time; even though I'm the one who made the rules, I am bound by them. With 15 seconds left, I take my pair, then pick the card to my corner right.</p>
			
			<p>"Uh…" It's text…'VIC'…</p>
			
			<p>While they're convulsing over what they just saw, a much more tolerable memory played, this time from their mind.</p>
			
			<p>(("WE ARE WOMEN!"</p>
			
			<p>"YEAH!"</p>
			
			<p>"WE DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH OUR BODIES!"</p>
			
			<p>"YEAH!"</p>
			
			<p>"WE DON'T NEED NO MAN TELLING US HOW TO ACT! OR HOW TO DRESS! WE DO WHATEVER THE HELL WE WANT, AND THEY CAN'T SAY A DAMN THING!"))</p>
			
			<p>Well, at least my opponent has recovered…wait, this is a protest for women! And my opponent made it clear that they're not a woman, so what gives?!</p>
			
			<p>Whatever. My next card…Huh. It's part of a book. Not a match.</p>
			
			<p>*SMACK!*</p>
			
			<p>Whoa, what's that sound? I look up and I see them on a stage literally assaulting a speaker with a red book, "Mind telling me why you booked his nose off? In front of the cops?"</p>
			
			<p>"I thought he was…He was spreading hate, he…he was telling us to-"</p>
			
			<p>"Look at his shirt. That's a pro-transgender shirt. He was going off against-"</p>
			
			<p>"I DON'T NEED TO HEAR IT FROM YOU!"</p>
			
			<p><b>—TIME REMAINING 43:35—</b></p>
			
			<p>My eyebrows raised, "Well, fine." I flip the cards face down.</p>
			
			<p>"What? You're not gonna say anything?!"</p>
			
			<p>"You just said you didn't need to hear it from me."</p>
			
			<p>That got them angry, "You have any idea what I'm gonna do to you if you don't take that back?"</p>
			
			<p>"Nothing," I point to the timer (10 seconds), "if you don't hurry."</p>
			
			<p>"GOD-" They hastily flipped over the card in front of them. Text: 'TIM'.</p>
			
			<p>((The memory plays of them going up to a random boy talking to a girl and going, "Hey, dickweed! Yeah, I'm talking to you! Leave her alone! She doesn't need you harassing her!"</p>
			
			<p>"What?! I was just-"</p>
			
			<p>"Shut up! Gimme that!"</p>
			
			<p>"My notebook!"</p>
			
			<p>"Names of girls you're gonna toy with! Hey, everyone! Look at this!"))</p>
			
			<p>Ok. I gotta know, "What was in that book?"</p>
			
			<p>"What?! What book?!"</p>
			
			<p>Playing dumb. Ok, talking won't help any, "Fine. Pick your next card."</p>
			
			<p>They stand up, walk to my right, and swipe the 'VIC' card while glaring at me. That allowed the memory to surprise them from behind.</p>
			
			<p>(("Look at these Republicans fighting among themselves, as if you have the right!"</p>
			
			<p>"What the hell do you want, bitch?"</p>
			
			<p>"You can help me get your hypocritical ass off my campus!"</p>
			
			<p>"Wait, why would I-"</p>
			
			<p>"Hey, he touched me! He touched me!"</p>
			
			<p>"You shut up! No I didn't!"</p>
			
			<p>"You groped me! Hey, he groped me!"</p>
			
			<p>"What?! NO, I-"))</p>
			
			<p>That memory ended with the two guys getting mauled.</p>
			
			<p>Let me try again, "Yeah, those two are absolute jerks, but you saw them not touch you once."</p>
			
			<p>"Well…they were thinking about it! You saw their fingers come close to me!"</p>
			
			<p>I want to facepalm myself, but that would get a rise out of them and unfairly waste their time, "Just go."</p>
			
			<p>"I will," they take the pair and flip the card next to that space. A picture, looks life half a golden rod. But this time, the realm goes completely black, save for the table.</p>
			
			<p>(("ODION! HELP ME!"</p>
			
			<p>"No, my boy. You musn't call on someone so unworthy. You are the one who must bear this responsibility."</p>
			
			<p>"NO! PLEASE, FATHER! I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS!</p>
			
			<p>"I will suffer your reluctance no longer! Now, accept the blessing of the Tomb Keepers!"</p>
			
			<p>"NO! PLEA-"))</p>
			
			<p>A man muffled his own son and began to carve hieroglyphics on his … I'd rather not say. But, "I think you'd better pick your next card."</p>
			
			<p>They looked like they were about to throw up, but then they looked at the timer and just grabbed a random-</p>
			
			<p>It's the rod's other half. Uh-oh. I know this one.</p>
			
			<p>(("From now on, these items are mine."</p>
			
			<p>"Marik, you shall inherit those when the time is right! And no sooner!"</p>
			
			<p>"Why don't you keep quiet, old man. I'm making my own rules now."</p>
			
			<p>"I order you to put that down!"</p>
			
			<p>"And if I don't?"</p>
			
			<p>"Marik, drop it!" That same man was suddenly flung against a wall, immobilized by a dark magic, "Oh, my son…"))</p>
			
			<p>And then the man was...I can't tell if he was sent to the Shadow Realm while dying, or if he escaped to the Shadow Realm before he died.</p>
			
			<p>My opponent was quite shocked at what they saw, "What the hell are you guys?! What the hell are you?! You're not even human!"</p>
			
			<p>"Yeah, as if that wasn't obvious enough…"</p>
			
			<p>"Stop messing with me! I demand to know what you are!"</p>
			
			<p>"The winner, if you don't hurry up."</p>
			
			<p>That snapped them out of it. Again, they grab a random card.</p>
			
			<p>Oh, this one's my memory. This one's got a red elephant's head on it.</p>
			
			<p>(("There are only two genders! I want you to say it!"</p>
			
			<p>"No, please leave me alone!"</p>
			
			<p>"Not until you say it, you goddamn whore!"</p>
			
			<p>"Someone help m~"))</p>
			
			<p>Yeah, you can figure out the rest of that. "Ahem."</p>
			
			<p>"What?!" They screamed.</p>
			
			<p>"Enjoying my memories so far?"</p>
			
			<p>"No! You're not supposed to…How are you even able to remember these?!"</p>
			
			<p>"Some memories, they're mine. Some, they belong to the spirits that inhabit me. Pick another card, and I'll keep talking."</p>
			
			<p>"Dammit…" they didn't have a choice. They flipped the next card, which was a Christmas Tree trunk. Not a match.</p>
			
			<p><b>—TIME REMAINING 39:52—</b></p>
			
			<p>Since that memory belonged to me, and it's a nice one, I'll talk, "You could call me they/them, because I am literally not one." I flip the tree trunk, "My entire being comprises of countless souls, whose lives ended before their appointed time."</p>
			
			<p>"Huh?! You mean, you…"</p>
			
			<p>"That's right," I say while flipping over a Christmas Tree top, "I am the human amalgamation of their deepest regrets. Their desire for a second chance at life." Then, I flip over…a red elephant's body, "They despair in true suffering, while you only pretend at it."</p>
			
			<p>"But I don't pret-" They were interrupted by those same men becoming powerful politicians, only for me to deal with them.</p>
			
			<p>I kept going as I flipped the red elephant's head, "That woman who was affected by those evil doers…you think you can live a day in her shoes? That kid from the village that got massacred? The son who was irreparably damaged by his father? You think you can live a day in their shoes?"</p>
			
			<p>"SHUT UP! I'm fighting for the right side of history! Where all people of all races and all genders can live in peace!"</p>
			
			<p>I flipped over a half chalkboard and half rainbow flag. Those memories showed my opponent disparaging a group of hispanics for refusing to participate in an LGBT rally, and her lecturing a classroom about the inherent racism of white people. Despite my opponent having…you know…</p>
			
			<p>"All people, huh?" I smirk, "Do those people count?"</p>
			
			<p>"No, they don't!" They took their turn, flipping a broken car's rear, "They're not part of our cause, and they chose a horrible leader! They deserve every bit of retribution that comes their way!" and a half rainbow flag.</p>
			
			<p>"How do you know they're actively fighting against your beliefs?" I flipped a field, "How could you say that when they could be looking for a place to escape the realities of this world?" and a broken car's front.</p>
			
			<p>"I just know! I know how hate spreads! Through ignorance and acceptance! We cannot accept hate whatsoever!" They got the broken car pair, but flipped the blackboard and flag again.</p>
			
			<p>"You know, being 'woke' used to mean something good. Actual survivors telling their stories so that actual victims finally get reparations," I claim both flag cards, "Now, people look at those survivors as heroes and think, "Oh! I relate to this person! I must be going through the same thing!" Disgusting," I flip a part of a book, and then I get the other book card, "People think that putting themselves in their shoes equates to struggle, but they're just deluding themselves."</p>
			
			<p>"You don't know what you're talking about! I'm actually trying to make a better world, while you're over here twiddling your thumbs and playing nonsensical games!" They scream while I flip a half a stadium and half chalkboard.</p>
			
			<p>I keep up this back and forth, gaining insight into their way of thinking. And it's exactly how it sounds. My reason for targeting this individual is because they instigated takedowns and submissions of other individuals who didn't deserve to be taken down. They've instilled the thought that anyone who doesn't agree to their cause is an enemy that doesn't deserve the chance to live a free life. Thanks to this memory concentration game, I found out where that mindset came from. This person has been captivated by several outspoken leaders who have actually been through the gauntlet of life, and have shared their experiences in the hopes that they would inspire the next generation to keep fighting for justice. This individual learned the wrong lessons and turned that fight into a fight for themselves. But I wasn't close to uncovering why they became like this.</p>
			
			<p><b>—TIME REMAINING 02:30—</b></p>
			
			<p>Endgame. Eight cards remaining. They are up two. They have built up a resistance to the memories so far, so they have a definite chance to win this. Though looking at them now, they seem fairly racked with despair and guilt over having seen those memories. Seeing. Some fighter you turned out to be.</p>
			
			<p>"You claim to fight for all people of all races of all genders," I say while they flip over half a motorcycle, showing a memory of someone falling into a chasm caused by a reactor meltdown, "Yet now do I see that you only fight for what benefits you personally." They flip over a cellphone, which showed my opponent using social media to dox those she deemed her enemies...</p>
			
			<p>"What are you doing, dragging me into this?!" They're still defiant as ever, "You're the one who's fighting for yourself, trying to put me in your place!"</p>
			
			<p>I flip a half fish, which showed a memory of me helping to feed a village in Africa, "Think what you want, because this Shadow Game is about to wrap up." And then I flip over a coffee cup, which not only ended my turn, but also showed…</p>
			
			<p><b>-CARD CLOCK 00:30-</b></p>
			
			<p>(("Oh, no! Don't you dare walk out on me!"</p>
			
			<p>"I'm sorry, but I don't think it's going to work out…"</p>
			
			<p>"You can't do this! I can't believe you'd choose that skank over me!"</p>
			
			<p>"At least she doesn't treat me like a servant! At least she understands me"</p>
			
			<p>"I put up the money! I pay all the bills! You can't even wipe your own ass! Why do I have to understand you?!"</p>
			
			<p>"You've never made time for me! You're out getting frisky with other people!"</p>
			
			<p>"So?!"</p>
			
			<p>"I try to have a conversation with another woman, and you get up in my grill about it!"))</p>
			
			<p><b>-CARD CLOCK 00:15-</b></p>
			
			<p>Oh no. Abusive heart. I've seen this before. It's a cause of a small number of people having mental breakdowns, but my opponent is locking up at this memory, so I'm guessing they're among small that number. It's their turn, but they've wasted 15 seconds, "Uh, hey. Pick your next card." Oh no, they're getting angry. 10 seconds left, "Hey! Pick a card, otherwise you'll-"</p>
			
			<p><b>-CARD CLOCK 00:10-</b></p>
			
			<p>"YOU WORTHLESS APE!"</p>
			
			<p>"No! Hey, stop!"</p>
			
			<p><b>"YOU'RE LUCKY I EVEN CONSIDERED YOU!"</b></p>
			
			<p>"You have to stop!"</p>
			
			<p><b>-CARD CLOCK 00:05-</b></p>
			
			<p><b><em>"YOU'RE A FUCKING HYPOCRITE, YOU STUPID HATEFUL IGNORANT PIECE OF SHIT! I HOPE YOU-"</em></b></p>
			
			<p><b>-CARD CLOCK 00:00-</b></p>
			
			<p><b>*BUZZZZZZZ*</b></p>
			
			<p><b>—PLAYER TIMED OUT—GAME OVER—</b></p>
			
			<p>Of all the pointless ways to lose…The table suddenly disappeared, and they was surrounded in a dark red aura field. "What?! Hey!" They tried to break free, but they're stuck, "No! I had more pairs than you! I should've won!"</p>
			
			<p>That's it. I've had enough, "Did you forget what I told you at the beginning of the game?!" I shoved the two timekeepers in her face; the big timer showed 1:02 remaining, but the stopwatch showed 0.</p>
			
			<p>At this point, they lost all feeling in their body and collapsed, "But…you said…I know you-"</p>
			
			<p>"<em>Yeah, I know!</em> I said, 'You'll have 30 seconds to pick your initial card; take too long to pick the first card, and the game automatically ends in your defeat.' You wasted 30 seconds on a memory that should've been a footnote."</p>
			
			<p>At that point, their eyes widened, and they finally realized the weight of their actions during the game, "Ah…no! Wait, I was just-"</p>
			
			<p>I take it back; they'll never realize, <b>"SAVE IT!"</b> I manifest my DuelDisk and slam it against the aura, causing it to shrink and phase into their head, <b><em>"PENALTY GAME! WALK OF LIFE!"</em></b> At that point, all the darkness disappeared, my opponent fainted, and I sprouted my wings and escaped to the top of a nearby office building before the flow of time resumed.</p>
			
			<p>Oh god…that was painful in more ways than one…having to learn why they did what they did…and that cop out ending…Gotta take a break…Wonder how that angry mob's getting on…</p>
			
			<p>"What happened?! Speak to me!"</p>
			
			<p>"No good! It's a coma! Call an ambulance!"</p>
			
			<p>"Where'd that guy go?!"</p>
			
			<p>"He did this!"</p>
			
			<p>"Someone help!"</p>
			
			<p>“Find that dude, then wrangle him!”</p>
			
			<p>"You can't leave us!"</p>
			
			<p>"Please! Anybody!"</p>
			
			<p>"We'll find you and we'll kill you!"</p>
			
			<p>Relax. They can still come back. They just have to spend some time enduring some of the hardships that the people they admire actually endured.</p>
			
			<p>Come to think of it, is this why I was led here? No, can't be it. But I guess that would explain why the voices have subsided a bit… I better find a place to rest.</p>
